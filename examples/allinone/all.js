/**
 * Example showing implementation of Device, Driver, and Clients.
 *
 * This example program demonstrates:
 * - Registering a Device object that exposes actions, metrics, and events to
 *    client applications.
 * - Installation of a Driver function that acts as middleware to inspect and
 *    potentially modify requests to/from a given device.
 * - Connection of a Client that interacts with the registered device.
 *
 * In this example, all three of the components are implemented locally as part
 * of a single stand-alone Node application. In a production environment, the
 * Device object would be implemented in device firmware (for example, on an
 * Arduino or Tessel), and the Driver functionality would be part of a managed
 * application installed directly on the Organiq gateway server. The Client
 * can be implemented in any application environment, such as a mobile or web
 * application.

/**
 * The Device object is used to expose device functionality to client
 * applications via the Organiq gateway server. A device object is normally
 * implemented in the device firmware as a simple declaration of the actions,
 * events, and metrics supported by the device.
 *
 * The Organiq SDK automatically exposes a Device object's methods, properties,
 * and events to remote Clients based on the JavaScript types.
